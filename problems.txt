Example problems that might be fun to do:

1.0 The O Trolls

TEXT:

The Owls of the forest have sent us an important message. Unfortunately, though, the O Trolls got to the
message before we could see it, and have added a whole bunch of "o" characters to the message so we can't
figure out what the original message was. Can you count how many "o" characters are in the message for us?

SUBMIT:

How many o characters are in the message?

HINTS:

- In python, you can do this:
	for ch in "hello":
		print(ch)

- In python, you can do this:
	if ch == "a":
		print("Saw an a")

- In python, you can do this:
	c = 1
	c += 1
	print("c is now {}".format(c))

1.1 The O Trolls, Part 2

TEXT:

After counting up the o characters, we realized that the message the Owls sent us must have had some
o characters to begin with, so we can't just remove all of the o's or we won't know whether they want
to see us soon or see our son. Luckily, the O Trolls are so fond of o characters that they will always
add at least three o's in a row when they add them. Can you figure out how many places in the message
the O Trolls messed things up?

SUBMIT:

How many places did the O Trolls add o's to the message?

HINTS:

- In python, you can do this:
	s = "some string"
	print("The first letter is {}".format(s[0]))
	print("The second letter is {}".format(s[1]))

- In python, you can do this:
	i = 1
	s = "some string"
	if s[i] == s[i + 1]:
		print("Some characters matched!")
