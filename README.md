# code-training
Simple code training/problem solving setup.

The basic idea here is to mimic, to an extent, the way that Advent of Code works
(www.adventofcode.com), but at a much more basic problem level, suitable for children
or other brand-new-to-coding folks to try out.

Things that need to be investigated:

 * How the overall flow is going to work as far as logins, sessions, etc., works
 * Whether we should try using cookies or not for session management
 * Setting up a docker container or something similar to keep things more locked down
 * If it would be possible to use https without crazy certificate nightmares
